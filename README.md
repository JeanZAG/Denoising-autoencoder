# Denoising-autoencoder

First commit of the denoising-autoencoder algorithm.
This code was originally intended for the SyncPy library : https://github.com/syncpy/SyncPy and should appear in https://github.com/syncpy/SyncPy/tree/master/src/Methods/utils
soon.
For now only gaussian noise is avalable.

This algorithm commes with two exemple of utilisation:
  -one that shows you exactly how the autoencoder is reconstructing data : it's a visual proof that the algortihm works properly!
  -the other one is an exemple of how you should use it for preprocessing.

Both exemples works on MNIST dataset.

dependencies : Python 2.7, TensorFLow, numpy, matplotlib
